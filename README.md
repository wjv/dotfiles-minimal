# dotfiles-minimal

* Minimal, portable dotfiles, which I can simply slap onto an arbitrary computer and start working.

* These have been extracted from my standard dotfiles. In some cases, they're an order of magnitude smaller.

* These are for my own use, so explanatory comments have been removed to keep them short.
